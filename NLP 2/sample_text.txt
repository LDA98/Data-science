In October 2024, the Global Forum on Digital Civilization was held in Vienna, Austria, bringing together
policymakers, corporate leaders, researchers, activists, and journalists from more than 120 countries.
The event was organized jointly by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
and the International Institute for Technology and Society (IITS), with financial support from the European
Commission and the Government of Canada.

Among the keynote speakers were Dr. Elena Marquez, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, and
Professor Ahmed Al-Khalidi, a historian from the University of Cairo, who presented a collaborative project titled
"Human Identity in the Age of Algorithmic Mediation." Their research argues that large-scale digital ecosystems
and AI-assisted decision structures are reshaping cultural memory, political identity, and even interpersonal
relationships.

On the second day of the conference, representatives from Google DeepMind, IBM Research, and the Alan Turing Institute
held a closed workshop focused on the regulation of autonomous decision-making systems in public administration.
During the session, the delegation from the Federal Republic of Germany proposed a new regulatory framework called
the Berlin Protocol, intended to replace the Digital Governance Act of 2018. The protocol emphasizes transparency,
auditability, and cross-border regulatory harmonization. France and Sweden supported the proposal, while India and
South Africa raised concerns regarding institutional access and implementation costs.

Meanwhile, a working group led by the African Union Commission presented a report documenting the effects of algorithmic
credit scoring in Nigeria, Ghana, and Rwanda, highlighting both increased financial inclusion and heightened risk of
systemic discrimination. The report recommended the establishment of a continental oversight board and called for
further collaboration with the African Development Bank and the World Bank Group.

During a special evening session at the Vienna State Opera, the forum hosted a cultural performance titled
"The Data Symphony," composed by Japanese artist Riku Yamamoto. The work combined classical orchestral arrangements
with real-time data visualizations projected onto a 40-meter stage screen. The performance was attended by UNESCO
Director-General Audrey Azoulay, Austrian Chancellor Lukas Schneider, and former U.S. President Barack Obama.

The closing session on October 19 was marked by a heated debate regarding the geopolitical implications of the
so-called "Digital Non-Aligned Movement," led by Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico. Analysts from the Brookings Institution
and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argued that the movement reflects a growing desire among emerging
economies to balance technological dependence and sovereignty. The final declaration of the Vienna Summit is expected
to be ratified in early February 2025 during the follow-up meeting in Singapore.
